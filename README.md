# Citation_Webscrape

I always felt that it was difficult creating in-text citations as it must directly reference the sentence you are citing. By the time you finish your work, you hardly remember most of the URLs you visited. My solution to this was to insert URL links into my document as placeholder in-text citation, which I would then convert to proper in-text citations once I was finished my work. Zotero sped this process up as it automatically created my bibliography and in-text citations.

However, Zotero required me to create a list of journals and determine which journal corresponded to each URL location. This was very tedious as I had to open each URL and type/copy the journal title. I wanted to create a process which directly converted URLs to in-text citations. 

Citation_Webscrape allows for entire documents to be cited given the URL links surrounded by a delimiter of choice. It uses webscraping at each URL to extract the key author and publishing date for APA format. 

# Future Development

Future steps with this project include adding other citation formats, automatically creating a bibliography like Zotero, and webscraping websites other than PubMed.
