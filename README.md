# Citation_Webscrape

I always felt that it was difficult creating in-text citations as they must directly reference the sentences you are citing. By the time I finished my work, I hardly remembered most of the URLs I visited. My solution to this was to insert URL links into my document as placeholder in-text citations, which I would then convert to proper in-text citations once I was finished with my work. Zotero sped this process up as it automatically created my bibliography and in-text citations.

However, Zotero required me to create a list of journals and determine which journal corresponded to each URL. This was very time consuming as I had to open each URL and type/copy the journal title to search for the Zotero citation. I wanted to create a process which directly converted URLs to in-text citations. 

Citation_Webscrape allows for entire documents to be cited given the URL links surrounded by a delimiter of choice. It uses webscraping at each URL to extract the key author and publishing date for the APA citation format. 

# Future Development

Future steps with this project include adding other citation formats, automatically creating a bibliography like Zotero, and webscraping websites other than PubMed.
